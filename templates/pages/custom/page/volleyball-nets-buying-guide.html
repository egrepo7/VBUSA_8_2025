                <h2>Volleyball Net Basics</h2>
                <p>Before diving into product options, it helps to understand the basics:</p>
                
                <div class="guide-card">
                    <h3>Standard Size</h3>
                    <p>Most indoor nets have a 2" top and bottom border along with 4" wide side borders. Most outdoor/beach nets feature wider 4" border along all 4 sides which make them easier to see when playing outdoors. We do make 2" border nets for outdoor also.</p>
                    <div class="guide-highlight">
                        <h4>üìù Note</h4>
                        <p>The thicker the border, the heavier the net so if you are trying to tighten a net with thin poles or want a lighter net to carry in a backpack we recommend 2" border nets. High end volleyball nets typically have wood dowels sewn into the sides of the net so when hung up they force the net to hang in a perfect rectangle. We can sew nets with removable dowels upon request also.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="guide-card">
                    <h3>Net Length & Height</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Net Length:</strong> Regulation nets are 32 feet long (Most volleyball poles are installed 36 feet apart. The net is wider than the boundary lines below the net to allow easy connection of antennas approximately one foot in from each side which players need to hit the ball between with competitive volleyball games).</li>
                        <li><strong>Heights:</strong> High quality volleyball nets should be 39 to 41 inches tall. We do not recommend 36" tall nets as you lose a full 4 inch square of vertical netting. You will notice with 36" tall nets that you will not be able to play the ball out of the net in common defensive plays in volleyball games as the net will be too short to capture the ball and rebound it back to a player.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Indoor nets are designed for gyms, schools, and competitive facilities. Standard indoor nets use 2" top/bottom borders for visibility and performance.

                    <h3>What's the difference between indoor and outdoor nets?</h3>
                    <p>Indoor nets traditionally use a 2" border, while outdoor nets have shifted towards a 4" border for extra player visibility with busy outdoor backgrounds. VolleyballUSA.com produces both indoor and outdoor nets with outdoor rated materials for prolonged usability.</p>

                    <h3>How long will a volleyball net last?</h3>
                    <p>With proper care, indoor nets last several years in gyms. Indoor nets are often replaced when they have become too dirty or have torn in the corners. Outdoor nets vary by environment. Many of our nets when purchased for occasional use throughout a summer will last a lifetime. If the net is hung up and left outdoors continuously all year round we see nets lasting 3-10 years. Places with high UV exposure will see the sun break down the color and material strength the quickest. You can purchase spray on UV protectants from many marine supply stores that can add a lot of protection to your net.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need Kevlar or steel cable?</h3>
                    <p>Kevlar cable nets are much easier to set up than steel cable nets. Kevlar cable nets are similar to tying shoe laces. Steel cable nets are sharp, can fray over time and we recommend wearing safety glasses when setting up. Steel cable nets are harder to cut down if theft is an issue.</p>
