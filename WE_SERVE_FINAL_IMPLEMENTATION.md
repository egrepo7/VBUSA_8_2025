# WE SERVE Section - Final Implementation

## âœ… Achieved Behavior

### 1. **Normal Page Flow Until Full View**
- Users scroll down the page normally
- Section appears as part of regular document flow
- **No interactions until 80% of section is visible** - text cycling only starts when fully in view

### 2. **Full Viewport + Scroll Lock When Active**
- When 80%+ of the section is visible:
  - Section becomes full viewport height
  - Header automatically hides
  - **Scroll is locked** until all words are cycled through
  - Text starts cycling on scroll actions

### 3. **Smart Text Cycling**
- Words cycle through in order: HOMEOWNERS â†’ PRO TOURS â†’ D1 COLLEGES â†’ SPORTS COMPLEXES â†’ ACADEMIES â†’ CLUBS â†’ HIGH SCHOOLS â†’ MIDDLE SCHOOLS â†’ CORPORATE
- Each scroll action advances to the next word
- **Scroll is prevented** during cycling
- Progress bar shows completion status

### 4. **Unlock After Complete Cycle**
- Once all 9 words have been shown, scroll is unlocked
- User can then scroll naturally to continue down the page
- Header reappears when leaving the section

### 5. **Clean Scroll Indicator**
- Text always shows: **"Scroll to continue"**
- No more confusing "X more to unlock" messaging
- Visual pulse animation guides user interaction

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements Made

### **Intersection Observer Enhancement**
```javascript
threshold: [0, 0.8, 1] // Only activates when 80% visible
```

### **Scroll Locking Logic**
- âœ… Prevents scroll until cycle complete
- âœ… Allows natural scrolling after completion
- âœ… Works with mouse wheel, touch, and keyboard

### **Text Cycling Precision**
- âœ… Only starts when section is fully in view
- âœ… Smooth transitions between words
- âœ… No premature activation

## ðŸ“± Cross-Platform Support
- **Desktop**: Mouse wheel scroll cycling
- **Mobile**: Touch swipe interactions
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys, Space, PageDown
- **Escape key**: Skip entire section

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Polish
- Header smoothly hides/shows with cubic-bezier easing
- Word transitions with opacity fading
- Progress bar updates as words cycle
- Scroll indicator pulses to guide interaction

## Current Status: **Ready for Testing** âœ…

The WE SERVE section now behaves exactly as requested:
1. Normal page flow until fully visible
2. Scroll lock with word cycling when active
3. Clean "Scroll to continue" indicator
4. Unlock after complete cycle
5. Header hide/show behavior
