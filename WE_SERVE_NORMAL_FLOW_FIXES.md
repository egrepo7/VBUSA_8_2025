# WE SERVE Section - Normal Page Flow Fixes

## Issue Fixed
The WE SERVE section was blocking the rest of the page with fixed positioning and scroll locks, preventing users from accessing content below it.

## Changes Made

### 1. CSS Changes (`_we-serve-section.scss`)
- **Removed high z-index**: Changed from `z-index: 999` to `z-index: 1` to prevent covering the header
- **Kept the section as normal flow**: Section remains in normal document flow, just takes up full viewport height when visible
- **Header hiding behavior maintained**: Header still hides when the section is in view using the `we-serve-active` body class

### 2. JavaScript Changes (`we-serve-section.js`)
- **Removed all scroll locking**: 
  - Changed event listeners from `passive: false` to `passive: true`
  - Removed all `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()` calls
  - Users can now scroll naturally through the section

- **Simplified scroll handling**:
  - Words still cycle on scroll when section is in view
  - No scroll prevention - users can scroll past at any time
  - Removed transition methods that forced scrolling to next section

- **Cleaned up state management**:
  - Removed `isLocked` property and related logic
  - Removed unnecessary transition methods
  - Simplified touch and keyboard handling

## Current Behavior
1. **Normal page flow**: Users can scroll down to reach the WE SERVE section naturally
2. **Full viewport height**: When the section is in view, it takes up the full viewport height
3. **Header hiding**: Header automatically hides when the section is in view
4. **Word cycling**: Words still cycle as the user scrolls through the section
5. **No scroll blocking**: Users can scroll past the section at any time
6. **Header restoration**: Header reappears when scrolling out of the section

## Benefits
- ✅ Users can see the rest of the page content
- ✅ No scroll lock frustration
- ✅ Natural scrolling behavior
- ✅ Section still provides the intended visual impact
- ✅ Header behavior works as expected
- ✅ Maintains all animations and visual effects

## Files Modified
- `/assets/scss/components/custom/_we-serve-section.scss`
- `/assets/js/theme/custom/we-serve-section.js`

The WE SERVE section now behaves as a normal section in the page flow while maintaining its full viewport height visual impact and dynamic word cycling functionality.
